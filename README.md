# GSoC 2025 – ilastik: Support Pixel Resolution Metadata

👋 Hi! I'm **Addapu Praharika**, a 2nd-year AI & ML student passionate about building real-world solutions with AI.  
This repository documents my journey, research, and contributions for my **Google Summer of Code 2025** proposal under the **Python Software Foundation (PSF)** and the **ilastik** sub-org.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Title:** Support Pixel Resolution Metadata in ilastik  
**Organization:** Python Software Foundation (PSF)  
**Sub-org:** ilastik  
**Goal:** Enhance ilastik's capability to support and preserve pixel resolution metadata (such as voxel size, spacing) across file formats and workflows. This will improve the accuracy of visualizations, quantitative analysis, and cross-platform compatibility.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

- ✅ Accurate scale-aware image analysis
- 📊 Meaningful results across biomedical imaging and microscopy
- 🔁 Interoperability with other imaging tools (e.g., Fiji, napari, ITK)
- 🔍 Consistency in training, prediction, and annotation workflows
